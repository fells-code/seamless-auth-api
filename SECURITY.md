# Security Policy for Seamless Auth API

Thank you for taking the time to help make Seamless Auth API more secure.

Seamless Auth API is a security-sensitive project used to protect authentication flows. As an open-source project, we take vulnerability reporting seriously.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security issue, **please do NOT open a public GitHub issue**. Instead, report privately via email:

**security@seamlessauth.com**  
Subject: `Security Issue: seamless-auth-api`

When possible, include the following information in your report:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (proof of concept if available)
- Affected versions or commits
- Suggested mitigation (optional)

We will acknowledge receipt within **3 business days** and work with you on a coordinated disclosure plan.

## What to Expect

Once a report is received:

1. We will acknowledge it within **3 business days**
2. We may ask follow-up questions for clarification or reproduction
3. We aim to fix critical vulnerabilities within **30 days**
4. Coordinated disclosure will be managed on a case-by-case basis

We will not publicly discuss security issues until a fix or mitigation is available.

## What to _not_ do

Please do not:

- Open a public issue describing a vulnerability
- Share sensitive details publicly
- Attempt to exploit the vulnerability in production or in ways that compromise user data

Responsible disclosure helps protect all users of this project.

## Best Practices

Seamless Auth API uses modern identity and crypto best practices, but you should always:

- Review configuration and deployment settings carefully
- Rotate signing and session keys periodically
- Use HTTPS and secure cookie settings in production
- Isolate your instance from untrusted networks
